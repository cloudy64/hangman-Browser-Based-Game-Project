2-game description:
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the computer thinks of a word and the user should guess it one letter at a time. For each wrong guess, part of a stick figure is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the full word or the stick figure is completed

-As a user, i want the guessed letters to be disabled or highlighted after I choose them, so I know which letters i already picked.

4-psuedocode for overall gameplay:

-) Define any variables used to track the state of the game:
//    The word to guess
//    The letters the user has guessed correctly
//    The letters the user has guessed incorrectly
//    The number of attempts remaining
//    A message to display (win or lose)
//    The match result - win/lose


-) Define the required constants:
//       -A list of possible words to choose from
//       - We'll need references to DOM elements for:
//       - displaying the word with blanks
//       - displaying wrong guesses
//       - displaying the hangman drawing
//       - showing the result message




-) Handle a player clicking a button




-) Handle random word selection



-) Compare the player choices and the word and check if guess it and tell if win or loss
